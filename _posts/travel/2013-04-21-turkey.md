Day 1:
Arrived at airport at 1830 local time.  Got a taxi to the hotel and tried a little bit of haggling here.  We got the trip for 40TRY (approx 14.40gbp).  When we arrived we noticed that there was a building that had been demolished on the corner of the block.  Rubble across the road and no traffic could get through. There were a few people standing around a huge dump trucks lined the streets.  It looked like a bomb had hit the site!  Not a good impression.  We checked in and dropped bags off at Monaco Hotel and went for a walk to the Sultanahmet District, Istanbul.  Took some amazing photos of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia at night time from the fountain.

Drew tried Burger King - quite different even though they have the same names.

First night - no sleep.  Trucks and machinery going all night clearing/demolishing the rest of the corner site.
